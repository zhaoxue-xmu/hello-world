# hello-world
This is my first repository on github, hello-world!
Zhaoxue here, I am a first-year graduate of xiamen university now.
I have a great time here, and i am interested in bigdata, data-mining, and i am working hard on it now.
I do not know what i can do in the future, and sometimes i am afraid to picture my future life.Anyway, i will try my best to deal with it. And wish me GOOD LUCK!!!
